	<h2>Introduction: The defenition of a website</h2>
	
	<h4>
		Hi there!<br>
		So you want to learn how to program. That's cool!<br>
		Before we start, I'll introduce you to the basic concepts of how computers communicate and how a website appears on your screen.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Server / Client</b><br>
		Ever wondered where websites come from? Well, here's your anwser: a server.<br>
		The server is basically a normal computer but it's made to send files.<br>
		The client is the computer we use every day, it receives files from the server. It looks a lot like this:<br>
		<img src="img/serverclient.png" width="400px">
		<br>
		When you want to view a website (say, tkon99.me), your computer (client) asks the server for this website. The server will then say "I can do that." and send the files of the website to your computer.<br><br>
		<b>Files</b><br>
		Yes, that's right. Files. The server only sends "text" in a raw form. Most people can't read this raw form, this is the programming language.<br>
		When the client receives a file it will look at it and create something visual out of it. (A logo for example).<br>
		<br>
		Now that you know the basics of a website we can start creating one.<br>
